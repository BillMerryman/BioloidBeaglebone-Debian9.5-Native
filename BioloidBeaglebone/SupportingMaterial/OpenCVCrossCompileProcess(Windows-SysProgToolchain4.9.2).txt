In OpenCV/platforms/linux folder, create a 'build' folder
copy CMakeCache.txt from native build on beaglebone to this folder
update all of the /usr references to start with the path of sysroot (e.g. C:/BBGCC/arm-linux-gnueabihf/sysroot)
update all of the references to the native desktop location to the local location (e.g. /root/Desktop/opencv to C:{pathToOpencv}
update all of the build tool paths to be to the cross compiler (e.g. C:/BBGCC/bin)
copy 'downloads' folder from BB opencv installation into C:\OpenCVCrossCompile\opencv-3.4.0\platforms\linux\build

open Cmake GUI and point it at the build directory, configure, and build

after this finishes, open a MinGW command  prompt (C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat)
