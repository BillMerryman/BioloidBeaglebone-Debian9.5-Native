in /opencv/platforms/linux create build folder
open command prompt
change to this folder
from this folder run:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake\bin\cmake.exe" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../arm-gnueabi.toolchain.cmake ../../.. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
it will fail the first time through, afterwards go to 
C:\Users\Bill\Desktop\opencv-master\platforms\linux\Build
open CMakeCache.txt
make sure all of the unfilled paths (like CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:FILEPATH=) are pointing to the cross compilers
run command again
after this finishes, open a MinGW command  prompt (C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat)
change to C:\Users\Bill\Desktop\opencv-master\platforms\linux\Build directory
run mingw32-make
and then mingw32-make install


//had to modify include/opencv2/core/types_c.h to add:

#include "opencv2/core/fast_math.hpp" 
after
#include "opencv2/core/cvdef.h" 

for it to compile into project in opencv 3.4
